Which works better, explainable AI or black-box AI?
=
Comparison of  two competing machine learning methods for quantitative regression model development: Today's AI-culture's  convolutional neural networks and Idletechs' EMSC & sparse OTFP/PLSR, with respect to

a) over-all similarities and differences 
b) robustness against measurement nois in the chosen sensor channels
c) interpretability and numerical stability.

This project would be advised by Frank Westad and co-advised by Joe Garrett
