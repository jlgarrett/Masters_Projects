Explainable hyperspectral AI for Lake Mjøsa
=

NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 3 years, and HYPSO-2 was launched last summer. It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra.

As part of NTNU's Mission Mjøsa, HYPSO-1 and HYPSO-2 have been recording images of Lake Mjøsa. 
To date, over 100 hyperspectral images have been collected. 
This project will involve developing a model that can integrate all the different images of Lake Mjøsa in order to extract information about physical variables such as the atmospheric composition and presence of algae. 
The model will be built on On-the-fly processing (OTFP), which is an AI framework for continually extracting information about a hyperspectral scene. 
More information about OTFP can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743916304555#f0005

This project will be a collaboration with IDLEtechs, a Trondheim-based buisiness that specializes in extracting usable information from big data and will be co-advised by Simen Berg, a PhD student who works with Mission Mjøsa.
