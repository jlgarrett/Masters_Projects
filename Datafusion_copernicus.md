Integrating the HYPSO constellation with the Copernicus Suite
=

The satellite HYPSO-2, launched in August 2024, is operated by the SmallSat Lab. 
Small satellite can be seen as complementary platforms to biggest satellites, such as those managed by ESA or NASA. 
The student will investigate how small satellite can be used in synergy to complement and enrich data coming from bigger platforms. 
The student will explore agile mission planning for HYPSO-2 applied to satellite cooperation and multi-observation in near real time.

Tasks:
Literature review on Cubesat-large platforms mission planning integration
Analyse a use-case, and propose a possible integration

The project will be co-advised by PhD student Corrado Chiatante
