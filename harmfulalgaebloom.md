Explainable hyperspectral AI for Harmful Algal Bloom monitoring
=

NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 3 years, and HYPSO-2 was launched last summer. It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra.

In order to better understand algal blooms, HYPSO has been collecting images near Vancouver Island, Canada, because many different kinds of harmful aglal blooms occur there.
To date, over 100 hyperspectral images of the location have been collected. 
This project will involve developing a model that can integrate all the different images ocean color variables such as chlorophyll-a and algae composition. 
The model will be built on On-the-fly processing (OTFP), which is an AI framework for continually extracting information about a hyperspectral scene.

This project will be a collaboration with IDLEtechs, a Trondheim-based buisiness that specializes in extracting usable information from big data and will be co-advised by Aria Alinejad, a PhD student who works with harmful algal bloom monitoring.
