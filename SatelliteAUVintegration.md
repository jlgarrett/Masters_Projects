Coordinated Planning between a satellite constellation and a Uncrewed Surface Vehicle
=

Since 2021, NTNU has participated in a field campaign in Frohavet, directly west of Trondheim. 
NTNU manages different sensors that are part of the so-called operational pyramid which has taken part in these missions.
The HYPSO satellites record images of hthe target 

In the observational campaigns, these instruments are deployed and managed through mission planning and data collection and analysis. 
HYPSO-2 is a Hyperspectral imagery that collects data over 120 bands. 
In situ data can be sampled by the Autonaut, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV). 
Integrating the mission planning of the instrument is pivotal to achieve synergy between the agents in the pyramid.

Tasks:
Review on satellite-ground agent coordination
Simulate the HYPSO-Autonaut case and analyse how to integrate mission plans for the use case, minimising data latency
Develop strategies for jointly planning satellite imaging and USV paths

This project will be co-supervised by PhD student Corrado Chiatante
