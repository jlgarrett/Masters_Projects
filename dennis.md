Agile imaging maneuvers for the HYPSO satellites
=
Agile imaging is a combined imaging and attitude maneuvering procedure that can improve satellite image quality while also improving coverage of imaging targets. Examples of such agile imaging maneuvers could be to take images while following coastlines, or rivers, or performing special maneuvers for sensor calibration purposes. Previous work has demonstrated the capability of HYPSO-1 and HYPSO-2 to perform agile pointing maneuvers. However, further work can be done to explore more possibilities.
This project can be about:
- Automating the planning and execution of agile imaging maneuvers for the HYPSO satellites
- Coming up with new agile imaging techniques and, if desired, performing them on the HYPSO satellites
- Optimizing and extending the agile imaging planning manuevers of the HYPSO satellites
- Analyzing/quantifying and improving the performance of agile imaging maneuvers on the HYPSO satellites
