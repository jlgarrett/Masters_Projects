Hyperspectral data fusion for HYPSO-3
=

NTNU smallsat lab is planning a new satellite, HYPSO-3, which will have several payloads, including multiple hyperspectral cameras. This project will explore how data from different hyperspectral cameras can be fused together through experiments with the HYPSO constellation and other hyperspectral satellites. We hope to achieve better accuracy and timeliness in various tasks, such as harmful algal bloom detection. 

Once launched, the HYPSO-3 satellite will be used for water quality monitoring of fjords and lakes in order to help Norway achieve the UN's sustainable development goals. â€‹Saving fish farms from harmful algal blooms is a particularly important goal of the HYPSO-3 mission.

Here is are two examples of multi/hyperspectral data fusion: http://naotoyokoya.com/assets/pdf/NYokoyaTGRS2012.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743920301180 . However, data fusion of two hyperspectral images is a novel topic, and few methods have been proposed to date.You could be one of the first to work on it globally!

Some programming experience might help with this project. I'll show you what you need to know about optics and spectroscopy, since they are not typical parts of the cybernetics curriculum.
