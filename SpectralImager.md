Calibration of Hyperspectral camera point-spread function
=
NTNU is developing a high-spatial resolution hyperspectral camera for its next satellite, HYPSO-3. This project will involve building a test setup the ITK's Optics Lab to measure the point-spread function (PSF) of hyperspectral cameras. The PSF describes how a single point of light is spread among the different pixels of a camera. The test involves coordinating the collection of camera data with the rotation and lateral motion of a small slit. The test is necessary for determining whether the HYPSO-3 camera functions as it is designed to. The project is ideal for students who've completed Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques, but it is not strictly required. 

Once launched, the HYPSO-3 satellite will be used for water quality monitoring of fjords and lakes in order to help Norway achieve the UN's sustainable development goals. ​Saving fish farms from harmful algal blooms is a particularly important goal of the HYPSO-3 mission.

​Skills that will be learned:​
- How to calibrate a camera
- What camera properties are important to spectral imaging​
- How cameras interact with other components in an autonomous system (in this case, a satellite)
- Some programming (probably python) for data analysis
