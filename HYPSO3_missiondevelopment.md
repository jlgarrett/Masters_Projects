What can the HYPSO-3 Hyperperspectral Cameras Observe?
=

NTNU smallsat lab is planning a new satellite, HYPSO-3, which will have several payloads, including multiple hyperspectral cameras. 
This project will explore how the higher spatial resolution of HYPSO-3 could open up to imaging opportunities, such as monitoring inland water, characterizing ships, and locating forest fires. 

It will include analysis of the HYPSO-3 instrument, and numerical investigations of data from aircraft-based hyperspectral imagers. 

Although the primary goal of HYPSO-3 is to image algal blooms, there are many secondary use cases for which it could also collect data: forestry, forest fires, agriculture, oil spills, etc.
