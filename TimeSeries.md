Explainable AI for Ocean Monitoring Time-series

NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 3 years, and HYPSO-2 is launched last summer. 
It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra. 

The Frohavet observational campaign has been carried out in the last 3 years, with different sensors being used, including Sentinel-3 data, HYPSO-1 and HYPSO-2, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, and other ground agents. The scope is to study algae bloom that are usually happening in April in Norwegian Coastal Areas.
However, new algorithms have been added in the ground processing pipeline, leading to the need of re-analysing the available old data to learn from previous campaigns.
This project will investigate those data and look for simple models which can incorporate multiple agents. 

Tasks:
- Analyse the recently reprocessed data that can contains new information
- Compare the results by the different agents, to find trends in the data.
- Analyse the quenching phenomena, which lead to higher levels of chlorophyll during the night.
- Analyse the maximum data latency for comparing the value of chlorophyll, given its temporal variability

This project will be co-advised by Cameron Penne, PhD student
