Prototype a Star tracker
=

Star trackers are a critical component that allows small satellite to determine their orientation. 
They are typically one of the most expensive components which is required for a cube satellite, and their sampling rate is typically about 1 Hz. 

Recently the NTNU small sat lab has come across new black silicon cameras which are sensitive to small amounts of light.
They might even allow relatively simple star trackers which can operate at a faster update rate. 

Some of the tasks in this project could be:
1) Take an image of the sky at night with one of the black silicon cameras (the small sat lab has tripods)
2) Map it to a star map to determine the orientation of the camera
3) Determine the fields of view and exposure limits under which 2) is possible

This project could be extended into a thesis to create a real-time attitude determination algorithm for the camera.

It will be co-supervised by PhD student Simen Berg and Postdoc Dennis Langer
