Multi-angle hyperspectral atmospheric compensation
=
NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 3 years, and HYPSO-2 was launched last summer. It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra.

One of the largest challenges for the HYPSO satellites is the atmosphere. Since they are 500km above the earth's surface, light passes through quite a bit of the atmosphere before it is detected by the sensor. 
Mitigating the effects of the atmosphere is critical to understanding what is happing on the earth's surface.
In addition, HYPSO's camera is built from commercial off-the-shelf components, and so is susceptible to some types of imaging imperfections. 
These perfections make standard atmospheric correction algorithms difficult to apply. 

This project will look into ways of controlling the satellite to take multiple images of a location in order to deduce the atmospheric correction. 
It will include both attitude control of the satellite and hyperspectral image processing.
