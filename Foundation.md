Explainable AI for Ocean Monitoring Time-series 
=

NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 3 years, and HYPSO-2 is launched last summer. 
It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra. 

Every year, the HYPSO team has participated in a mission with NTNU's biology department in Frohavet, to the West of Trondheimsfjord. This project would focus on integrating those data 


​Skills that will be learned:​
- Machine learning (various python libraries)
- Processing large datasets 
- Hyperspectral image processing 

Notes:

I will find a co-advisor for this project. The HYPSO project usually has about 10 masters students working on projects, so there will be others to chat with about your project and to socialize with. 
This project can be continued as a thesis. Although this is an extremely interesting research topic, I also think that it may be fairly challenging relative to the other masters project topics that I've offered. 
A love of mathematics is more important than prior machine learning experience, as I think some analytic derivations will probably be necessary for understanding how the networks operate.
