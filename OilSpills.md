Could a short-wave infrared hyperspectral imager characterize oil spills?

Oil spills can be disasterous for the environment. 
Therefore, it would be beneficial if they could be characterized immediately using remote sensing. 

Fortunately, the Norwegian Space Agency and Norsk ElektroOptikk (NEO) are planning to lauch the HYPERNOR SWIR hyperspectral imaging camera in a few years. 
While current satellites can localize oil spills quite well, this new camera has the potential to give volume and type estimates of oil spills.
It can potentially resolve the interference patterns and absorption lines that characterize oil on the surface of the ocean. 

Even though the HYPERNOR has not yet been launched, we can access AVIRIS data recorded from aircraft from the Deep Horizon oil spill of 2010, and use them to determine what can be resolved. 

There are several companies which could potentially collaborate with this thesis, but nothing is confirmed.
