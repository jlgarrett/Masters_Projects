How can an atmospheric compensation algorithm accomodate commerical off-the-shelf sensors?

Small satellites carrying hyperspectral imagers have the potential to revolutionize earth observation. 
In particular, NTNU's cubesats, HYPSO-1,-2, can image detailed spectral information of the ocean. 

However, most of what HYPSO observes is the atmosphere between its camera an the ocean. 
The effects of the atmosphere on the images it collects must be mitigated before the data can be used.
