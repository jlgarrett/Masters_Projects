Biophysical simulation for data generation
=

NTNU's HYPSO-1 satellite has been collecting hyperspectral data of coastal oceans for 3 years, and HYPSO-2 was launched last summer. It has collected of 2.000 hyperspectral images, or more than a billion individual spectra.


In order to develop models for prediction of chlorophyll-a and algae composition ground truth data needs to be matched to the hyperspectral captures. Acquiring these matchups has several inherent difficulties. The limited range and lifetime of hyperspectral cube satellites makes this task even more challenging. To address the problem this project will focus on development of a pipeline for generation of synthetic data of ocean properties using biophysical simulations.
